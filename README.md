Teamwork: Teams can be made up of: -             1 person (Individual) - 2 people (Pair) - 3 people (Trio) However, if you work as a pair or trio the expectation of the level of complexity and polish will be increased due to the number of people focused on one project Deliverables: - Finalised Mobile Application Solution - Summary Report (1000words +/-10%) 
Instructions Congratulations! The   presentation   you gave earlier of   your draft concept for mobile   technology   impressed the directors ofthe   technology company, and they are eager   to hear   more! They   have   invited you back but this time they are expecting to   see   a working   prototype.   You   will   submit   to them   a   mobile   App   using   the   techniques   taught   in   this   course   (written   in   C#   and   MAUI   using   Visual   Studio).
In addition to your complied and runnable application you will   also provide the   directors with   the full code behind your project and a document with   further information.You will provide a   1000 word written summary of   your project. This requires a lot of   care: you   have a maximum of   only   1000 words and you will quickly run out of   space if   you do not write   concisely. This will be submitted as a PDF   document.
The   pdf   document   mentioned   above   will   include:
•         Your student name(s) and number(s)
•         Title   of   your   project
•         Explanation of   the purpose of   your project, what it does, how it works, what real world problem it solves, all in   1000 words. Any text over   1000   words   will   be   ignored.
•         Your design documents including storey boards, data management, etc.
•         Feature set included (sensors, hardware, software, etc)   and why   they   were   used.
•         What you planned to do, how you would have done it, and why it was not   completed.
•         The   approximate   percentage   contribution   of each   member,   along   with   a   statement   to   say that each team member has agreed to this percentage.
•         An   individual   signed   cover   sheet,   or   a team   cover   sheet   signed by   all members   of   the   team and then   scanned.
•         Any references for where code may have been sourced from.Pay attention to your user interface. It should be intuitive and easy to use. Test the operation of   yo代 写INFT2051 – Mobile Application Development Final ProjectR

Especially   if you   think   a program might   crash,   avoid   showing the   feature that makes   it   do   so.   You   will   receive   marks   for   correct   operation   of   the   program,   and   for   task   complexity:   the   more   complex   your   task   is,   the more marks you will receive.Pay   attention   to   the   readability   of   your   code. Do   not   use   variable   names   such   as   x1   or   j   unless they   are   clearly   informative   in the   context   of   your   code. Use   classes, methods,   and   functions   where appropriate to separate your code into logical parts. Include   informative   comments.
Approaches that are not acceptable include:
•         A   programming   project   that   does   not   use   the   methods   and   techniques   discussed   in   this course.
•         Any material or software that has been submitted for   assessment   for   another   course.
•         Any   material   prepared   by   another   person/team,   unless   you   clearly   indicate   which   is   your own work.
•         A   presentation   that   fails   to   show   the   project   working.
Teamwork This may be an individual or team assessment, as advised by the course coordinator. Individual   marks will be the   same   as   overall marks   unless   there   is   an   obvious   mismatch   in   contribution   (such as a member not clearly contributing to the development of   the application) but evidence   of   this   lack   of contribution   should be   clearly provable   (e.g.,   screenshots   from your   chat,   lack   of   contributions   in   GitHub   etc.).
