Project Progress Presentation Worth: 15% Due: Week 8, Sunday 23:59 Submit to Online Canvas 


Teamwork: Teams can be made up of: -             1 person (Individual) - 2 people (Pair) - 3 people (Trio) However, if you work as a pair or trio the expectation of the level of complexity and polish will be increased due to the number of people focused on one project Deliverables: - Recorded Video - PowerPoint Slides - Your current Visual Studio Code Files Video Duration - Individual: 8minutes (+/- 1minute) - Groups: 12minutes (+/- 1minute) 
Number of Slides - 10-20 o This is a suggested number; this will   vary depending   on the amount of code present in the solution. o This can include title, content, and reference slides 
Instructions You   must   prepare   a   project   progress   report   illustrating   how   the   development   of   your   concept for   a   mobile   app   is   progressing.   This   should   be   treated   as   an   updated   draft   from   the   Pitch   presented   earlier in the   Semester   and the practical   project   will   continue   to   be   developed   over   the   remainder of   this   course. As such, it should incorporate   the   techniques/technologies defined   in the course outline and be achievable in the time frame   of   this   course.
Your presentation should include:
•         A   description   of   the   purpose   and   core   functionality   of   the   app
•         Updated Wireframes or mock-ups illustrating your app concept – this should   show us the before and after (how it was in Week   3   and how   it   looks now)
•         Any external technologies required to construct this app (e.g., APIs,   style. guidelines, package libraries)
•         Technical hurdles you anticipate and logical plans to   overcome these.
•         An action plan illustrating progress milestones   and goals
•         Presentation   should   include   a   discussion   about   the   difficulties   you   have   faced   during   this project and how you will overcome them in the remaining time   in   the   course   (e.g.,   coding difficulties, time constraints   etc.)
•          Should demonstrate that there is some code present   in   the project   that   works   (note   this   does not mean a fully functioning app, but some   code   should be present)
It should NOT include:
•      代 写INFT2051 – Mobile Application Development Project Progress PresentationPython
代做程序编程语言   A   completely   unrealistic   or   over-ambitious   idea   for   a   project   with   no   concrete   idea   of how it will be achieved.
•         Any materials submitted for assessment for another course.
•       Any   materials   prepared   by   another   person/team. All   materials   presented   must   be   your own work.Your presentation will be   assessed   against both verbal   and visual   criteria,   as   either   a physical   or   digital presentation   during the tutorial.   Online   submissions must   contain   a   PowerPoint   file   of slides   used   in   the   presentation,   and   a   video   submission.   Video   format   is   up   to   you   but   is   marked   on   the   same   criteria   as   the   physical   presentation.   One   approach   is   to   record   a   zoom   session   with   your   team,   screen   sharing   your   slide   deck.   Try   to   use   an   engaging   presentation   style. to clearly communicate your concept in a way that   other   students will understand.Please   prepare   for   your   presentation   by   rehearsing    and   ensure   you   do   not   go   over   time.   Presentations should be no longer than the time limit (8 minutes for an individual or   12 minutes   for   a   group).   Only   the   first   8   (or    12)   minutes   (+/-    1   minute)   will   be   marked,   any   content   presented after this will not be marked.
Teamwork This assignment may be completed individually or as a group of   two. Individual marks will be   the same as overall marks, unless there is a   clear   mismatch   in   group member   contribution.   All   members   of   a   team   must   be   present   and   participate   in   the   presentation.How to submit your assignment
